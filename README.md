The program performs various calculations on matrices and displays the output using a formatted pattern. These outputs can be stored in an external text file.An external text file can be used to read values and make a matrix out of them using the read function.
Before running the program, you must ensure that a “Text.txt” is opened inside of Visual Studio. If it is not opened, then simply add it by “adding new item in source file”.
